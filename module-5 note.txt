        ---------------------------

MVC ARCHITECTURE
----------------
M - Model 
V - View
C - Controller

components of MVC
-----------------
1) View (frontend) -send request
2) Routing - set the path to resolve the request
3) Controller - resolve the request 
4) Model - structure in which data to be stored in database
5) database - store the data.

NODE
----
- not a pgming language.
- it provides a runtime environment for javascript to run outside the browser.
- file extension - .js 

EXPRESS
-------
- framework of node 
- there have different predefined methods . by using this methods we can create server


Node Modules
------------
- modules are files/javascript library that can be used in node.js application to provide specific functionalities.
- import - require keyword
- export - module.exports


Types of modules
----------------
1) Custom modules
2) BuildIn modules

Different types of BuildIn modules
----------------------------------
1) file system modules
   - it allows us to work with files inside file system on your computer/programs files
   - they performs various operations like reading writing creating and deleting files.
   
import - require('fs')

common uses
-----------
1) read files - fs.readFile()
2) create file - fs.open()
3) write - fs.writeFile()
4) delete - fs.unlink()


2) http module
   ------------
- it allows node.js to transfer data over http request
- it can create http server that listen to server ports and gives response back to the client
- method - createServer() - http server
- method - listen() - (to set a port inside listen())

3) https module
   ------------

4) Event Module
   ------------
- to generate events
- based on EventEmitter()
- object of that particular class
- on() method is used to create events 
- emit method is used to execute the events


global object
-------------
- it provides global variables and functions that are available through out the node js application.(global scope)
 
 examples
 1) console - console.log - display content
 2) setTimeOut (for time delay) ,setInterval (regular intervel) 
 3) clearTimeOut ,clearInterval


 environment variables
 ---------------------
 - these are predefined variable or values that are typically used to provide the ability to configure a value in your code from outside of your application
 - provides information about the environment in which the process is running
 
express
-------
- framework of node.js

steps to create express server
------------------------------
1) npm init -y - install package.json
   - edit the script key
   - index.js is the only file that runs at the backend
   - start - index.js
   
2) npm install dotenv cors express mongoose
        - express - to create server
        - dotenv - to load environmental variables from .env file(which have environmental variables)
        - cors - cross origin resource sharing - to communicate between frontend and backend(to connect frontend and backend)
        - mongoose - to connect server and database.
3) .env file - to hold environmental variables
4) create .gitignore file - files that have to be ignore while pushing to git.
      * node_modules - it is a big file so we haven't push into git
      * .env - while hosting the website we have to provide the environmental variables. so no need to push .env file into git.
5) create index.js file.

   steps in index.js 
   -----------------
   1)import dotenv module.
   2) import express
   3) import cors
   4) create server
   5) use cors by server
   6) convert json into javascript object
   7) set port - (to avoid the clash if both frontend and backend works in a same port.so set a different port to backend)
   8) run server

   CRUD OPERATIONS
   ---------------
   C - create -POST
   R - read -GET
   U - Update -PUT
   D - Delete -DELETE
